## General info
It is one of the Data Analysing projects which is suppoused to hone my skills in that category.

Main goals of the project were:
* How to create a Choropleth to display data on a map.
* How to bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly.
* How to create sunburst charts with plotly.
* Use Seaborn's .lmplot() and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the row, hue, and lowess parameters.

As a notebook I used Datalore from Jetbrains.

It's one of the projects from [Angela's Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
